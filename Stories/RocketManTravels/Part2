A weird feeling started to build up in the Rocket Man’s gut, “Did she really see me shoot Aleia?” he pondered to himself?

His thoughts race, “Who is the little girl? Did she see her die?”

Another voice came from the crowd, “It will be okay, little one.”
The Rocket Man looked over at the voice and seen that a middle-aged man has taken the young child into his arms.

“Everything will be fine. I promise.” he spoke to the child.

As the man kept comforting the little child, Rocket Man walked over to him and asked, “Is she okay? did she see?”

The middle-aged man, dressed in a black undergarment with a white silk robe, named Atille, answered “Yes, she seen it all. But she hasn’t come to terms with who it was.”

“I knew who it was, but who was it to her?” Rocket Man asked Atille.

“The adults here knew, Aleia, as an illegal parts trader, but the children knew her as a their Tech teacher.” Atille spoke. “Though this little girl was her adopted daughter. Aleia took her in after biological parents were killed in the Ice Belt War.”

Rocket Man bent down to comfort the small child, “Everything will be okay. This man will explain everything to you, but I must be getting back to work.”

Leaning back up, Rocket Man stated, “The Ice Belt War was a tragedy we shouldn’t have endured. I’m sure you understand.” 

Atille nodded as he picked the child, “Yes, we know all too well. “

Atille and Rocket Man turned away from each other. 

“Rocket Man to E.C.H.O.”
“Rocket Man to E.C.H.O.”
“I am leaving Terra and should be partnered up with the main hub shortly.”
“Roger, Rocket Man, See you then. “
