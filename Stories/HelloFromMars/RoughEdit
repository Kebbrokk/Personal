0.1 - Synopsis
Hello From Mars is the story of Evan Denver, a man from Ijamsville, Indiana, who filled out a ticket online to be one of the first humans on Mars, and he was chosen but it wasn't for the reasons he believed.
When Evan meets up with the Space Agency in Indianapolis, they run him through months of tests and training scenarios to prepare for his long trek to the foreign red planet.
The Agency sets a date, and Evan goes down for the long sleep. Evan then starts his long journey to Mars, asleep.
But what he doesn't know is Evan never leaves his sleep, Evan never Earth's Atmosphere. Evan is planted firmly on the ground in the The Agency's facility, in a coma hooked up to many computers that will recreate his journey to Mars
